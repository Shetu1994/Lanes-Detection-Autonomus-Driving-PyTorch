We also know that most dogs sit and roll over. Those two pieces of information (name and age) and those two behavior (sit and roll over) will go in our <b>Dog</b> class because they are common to most dogs. This class will tell Python how to make an object representing a dog. After our class is written, we will use it to make individual instances, each of which represents one specific dog."

    "In this tutorial, you learned how to write your own classes. You learned how to store information in a class using attributes and how to write methods that give your classes the behavior they need. You learned to write `__init__` methods that create instances from your classes with exactly the attributes you want. You saw how to modify the attributes of an instance directly and through methods. You learned that inheritance can simplify the creation of classes that are related to each other."
